This method works by creating a DHCP server on the Pi's ethernet connection and internally it 'shares' the internet access between eth0 and wlan0. A device connected to the Pi's ethernet will get an IP address from the Pi, not the WiFi, but will still have internet access.

I used a jessie light image but it should work with any... The only package that is needed is dnsmasq however from a clean install it is a good idea to make sure everything is up-to-date:
Code: Select all

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get install rpi-update dnsmasq -y
sudo rpi-update
Reboot before continuing.

Connect to WiFi
First, setup the wifi connection that will be bridged to the ethernet.
Code: Select all

sudo nano  /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
Add:
Code: Select all

network={
        ssid="mynetwork"
        psk="secret"
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
Ethernet Static IP
Next, setup a static ip for the dhcp server.
Code: Select all

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
Comment out the existing eth0 line and add:
Code: Select all

#iface eth0 inet manual
allow-hotplug eth0  
iface eth0 inet static  
    address 172.24.1.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 172.24.1.0
    broadcast 172.24.1.255
dnsmasq setup
Save the old dnsmasq conf file and create a new one.
Code: Select all

sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.orig  
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
Add:
Code: Select all

interface=eth0      # Use interface eth0  
listen-address=172.24.1.1 # Explicitly specify the address to listen on  
bind-interfaces      # Bind to the interface to make sure we aren't sending things elsewhere  
server=8.8.8.8       # Forward DNS requests to Google DNS  
domain-needed        # Don't forward short names  
bogus-priv           # Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.  
dhcp-range=172.24.1.50,172.24.1.150,12h # Assign IP addresses between 172.24.1.50 and 172.24.1.150 with a 12 hour lease time  
Enable IPv4 forwarding.
Code: Select all

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
Uncomment the following line:
Code: Select all

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
IP Tables
Add this:
Code: Select all

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE 
Configure it to load on reboot by first saving it to a file:
Code: Select all

sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"
Then create a 'hook' file with a line to restore the ip tables :
Code: Select all

sudo nano /lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/70-ipv4-nat
Add:
Code: Select all

iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat
After a reboot you should automatically connect to your wifi and, assuming it has internet access, anything plugged into your Pi's ethernet port will have internet access as well.

Good luck...
