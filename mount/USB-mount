To enable everyone rw access, the key is umask=0 option to mount command.
mkdir /home/pi/bering/usb-drive
sudo mount -o umask=0 /dev/sda2 /home/pi/bering/usb-drive
umask=0 is enough, uid and gid just for sake of clarity, so you don't see more 'root' owners than necessarily.

@Tom's answer (writing /etc/fstab entry) will allow you to skip sudo and if you write umask=0 as additional option there, you'll get best of both worlds:

Having this in /etc/fstab:

/dev/something /mnt/somewhere auto users,noatime,umask=0 0 0
allows you to just run

mount /dev/something
and everyone has access to all files.
